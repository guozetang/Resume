% 2D shooting game using C++ & SDL
% 
% 
% Feb 2018 - May 2018
% A stable 2D shooting game with well-controlled player sprites were successfully created with no memory leak and crash.
% Using C++ and SDL2.0 as the technology stack. Various design patterns were used as the fundamental of the project, such as singleton, factory, object pool, observer, flyweight, strategy.
% Bitcoin price predictor based on LSTM neural network
% 
% 
% Feb 2018 - May 2018
% Utilized sentiment analysis and LSTM neural network to create a Bitcoin price predictor.
% The predictor can forecast the price trend of Bitcoin (up/down) as well as, the actual price of Bitcoin with a relatively
% higher prediction accuracy (almost 51.2%) than the traditional linear time series analysis model.
% Chatbot based on AWS
% 
% 
% Aug 2017 - Dec 2017
% Designed a smart Chatbot using Amazon Lex and Polly services. The whole system was built on HTML5, JavaScript
% and SDK provided by AWS.
% Built the communication and interaction module for the Chatbot, utilized Google search API if user input can't be
% fulfilled with an appropriate action.
